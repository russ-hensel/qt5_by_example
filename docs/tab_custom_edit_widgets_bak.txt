RshCustomEditWidgets   -- with some sql

This tab is related to custom versions of QLineEdit, QTextEdit...
which have been extended for the use with database queries and thier
interaction with the user.
All these edits relay on a QSqlTableModel to interact with the DB
  It is also a place to test out the coding
and implementation of the edits

---- Purpose/Functionality
        see top of file
        
        plus.... 
        
        The tab is connected to the example database and can progress forward
        and backward thru a short list of id's in that database.
        The table in use is the people table.
        
        No data is fetched until the prior or next button is pressed.
        
        We fetch data one row at a time
        
        Afte the data is fetched the user may interact with the
        data on the screen, but there ( so far ) is no save functionality.
        
        There is some insert functionality, but only to the screen
        the inserted data is not saved.
        
    ---- Function of the Edits  
    
        The edits have the usual functions of the parent edits plus functions 
        to facilitate their use with a database.
        
        * move data from a QRecord to an QEdit doing desired conversions.
        * clearing data from the edit
        * defaulting values into the edit
        * tracking if the data has been changed
        * copying ( or is it retaining ) value from one record for the next
        * validate data in the edit
        * moving data from the edit back to the record 
        
         
        
---- User interaction

        note: the collection of the edits on the screen is a "form"

        prior             fetches the prior record from the db, wraping at the end of its list 
        next
        insert_default    inserts a new record into the form using the "default" set up in each
                          edit
        
        insert_prior     inserts a new record into the form using the "default" set up in each
                         edit ( but is this not the same as keep-prior
                          
        clear             inserts a new record with the edits cleard  
        
        context_menu     on edits -- see what is there

        How do I clear a QSqlTableModel of all data -- is there a clear function 
        

        
---- Ideas for Improvement
        
        ** context menu for edit inc str() 




    Allow for db updates and additions --- or should this just be in stuffdb
