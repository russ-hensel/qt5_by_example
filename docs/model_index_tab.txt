In this example we use a ModelIndex to index a couple  of

columns in boith a tableModel from the abstract and in
a QSqlTableModel.

After getting data in eithr model click on a row

and see that the indexer is build, gets a key and
findes ths row.

All this code is to no purpose her except to illustrate the indexer.
