# qt5_by_example

we have one application with many tabs.  Each tab illustrates the
use of some of of qt5's widgets. ( this replaces my app qt_by_example which will
be deleted real soon )

The code for each tab is easy to find, read, understand, and copy.

A search feature help you find the tab for your widget....

Currently the app has been run on both linux mint and windows.

Whatch for updates and for postings here of any overall change in status.

Status:
    Running, 
    Infested with dead but harmless code.
    Repo may be incomplete -- contact author if anything found missing
    There are on the order of 40 tabs, but coverage of qt is still very
        incomplete 
ehnancement
Install:
    There is no install the intent is to run from your dev environment
    -- the whold app is intended for programmers.
    Put in your dev environment, launch the main app and look for dependencies
    wat-inspector ( on pip and conda-forge ) and a peice of qt that will
    let itself be known.
    I run in python 12, but I think it runs in .10 and maybe even lower.

    I will help anyone motivated to run this.
