# qt5_by_example

This is a single GUI application with many tabs.  Each tab illustrates the
use of some of of qt5's widgets. ( this replaces my app/repository "qt_by_example" which will
be deleted real soon )

It is also part of a book in progress: What We Know About QT5 -- see the Wiki -- join in!

Also included is a GUI version of wat-inspector a great little introspection
utility.

    wat -- check it out:
    igrek51/wat: Deep inspection of Python objects

The code for each tab is easy to find, read, understand, and copy.

A search feature help you find the tab for your widget....

Currently the app has been run on both linux mint and windows.

Contributions:

    While this repo is not set up for outside contributions I would more than
    welcome them.  Contact me and we can work out the best way to do this.

    You can use this as a way to help others learn/use qt or to help yourself,
    I commonly use qt5_by_example to make sure I am writing correct code.
