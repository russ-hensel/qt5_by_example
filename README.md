# qt5_by_example

This is a single GUI application with many tabs.  Each tab illustrates the
use of some of of qt5's widgets. ( this replaces my app/repository "qt_by_example" which will
be deleted real soon )

Also included is a GUI version of wat-inspector a great little introspection
utility.

    wat -- check it out:
    igrek51/wat: Deep inspection of Python objects
    https://github.com/igrek51/wat
    
The code for each tab is easy to find, read, understand, and copy.

A search feature help you find the tab for your widget....

Currently the app has been run on both linux mint and windows.

Watch for updates and for postings here of any overall change in status.
Contact the author for questions.

Status:
    Running, 
    Infested with dead but harmless code.
    Repo may be incomplete -- contact author if anything found missing
    There are on the order of 40 tabs, but coverage of qt is still very
    incomplete.
 
Install:

    There is no install the intent is to run from your dev environment
    -- the whold app is intended for programmers.
    Put in your dev environment, launch the main app and look for dependencies
    wat-inspector ( on pip and conda-forge ) and a peice of qt that will
    let itself be known.
    I run in python .12, but I think it runs in .10 and maybe even lower.

    I will help anyone motivated to run this.

Contributions:

    While this repo is not set up for outside contributions I would more than
    welcome them.  Contact me and we can work out the best way to do this.

    You can use this as a way to help others learn/use qt or to help yourself,
    I commonly use qt5_by_example to make sure I am writing correct code.
